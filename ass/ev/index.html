l.push_back(6.5);
l.push_back(7.0);
EuclideanVector c(l.begin(),l.end()); // a Euclidean Vector in 3 dimensions constructed from a list of magnitudes
</pre>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You may assume that all arguments supplied by the user are correct</li>
	<li>It's <b>very important</b> your constructors work. If we can't validly construct your objects, we can't test any of your other functions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2. Destructor</h3>
You must explicitly declare the destructor as default.

<h3>2.3. Operations</h3>

<h3>3.4. Friends</h3>

In addition to the operations indicated earlier, the following operations should be supported as friend functions.
Note that these friend operations don't modify any of the given operands.

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td>operator==</td>
    <td>True if the two vectors are equal in the number of dimensions and the magnitude in each dimension is equal.</td>

    <td><pre>std::cout &lt;&lt; a;</pre></td>
  </tr>

<h3>3.5. Internal Representation</h3>

unique_ptr<double[]> a = std::make_unqiue<double[]>(8);



<h3>3.6. Move Semantics</h3>

An Euclidean vector, once moved (by your move
constructor or move assignment operator), must be
left in a valid state. In principle, a moved-from object
can be written into but not read from. For marking
purposes, please put a moved-from Euclidean  vector
in such a valid state that calling the output operator
 &lt;&lt; on it will result in the output 
<pre>
[]
</pre>
with nothing inside the brackets.





<h3>3.7. Other requirements</h3>
You must:
<ul>
  <li>Include a header guard in EuclideanVector.h</li>
  <li>Use C++17 style and methods</li>
</ul>

You must not:
<ul>
  <li>Write to any files that aren't provided in the repo (e.g. storing your vector data in an auxilliary file)</li>
  <li>Add a main function EuclideanVector.cpp</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Getting Started</h2>

<p>If you haven't done so already, clone the repository:</p>

<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/cs6771/comp6771 comp6771</pre>

<p>Then navigate to the <b>assignments/ev</b> directory</p>

<p>All of the files you need are in this directory. Here is a list of files that and a description of their purpose:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
	<tr>
		<th>File</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>client.cpp</th>
		<th>A simple use case of a client using your euclidean_vector</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>euclidean_vector.(cpp|h)</td>
		<td>Your euclidean vector interface and implementation. The reference solution is around the 500 lines of code mark (to give you a sense of the size)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>euclidean_vector_test.cpp</td>
		<td>Your tests for your euclidean vector file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
    <td>BUILD</td>
    <td>Build file containing build, test, dependency instructions</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<H3>4.2. Reference Solution & Time Limits</H3>

<p>Due to the simple nature of this data type, there will be performance based measurements</p>
<p>Each test will still have a time limit to run (1 second max), but unless you do something completely insane this will be more than enough time for all of your operations to complete.</p>

<h3>4.3. Running your assignment</h3>

<h4>4.3.1. Running a basic use case</h4>

<p>You can run your code against a basic (non-testing) use case to get a better sense of the behaviour</p>

<p>From your project directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ bazel build //assignments/ev:client</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ ./bazel-bin/assignments/ev/client | diff client.sampleout -</code></pre>

<h4>4.3.2. Running your tests</h4>

<pre><code>$ bazel build //assignments/ev:euclidean_vector_test</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ ./bazel-bin/assignments/ev/euclidean_vector_test</code></pre>

<H3>4.4. Assessment</H3>
<P>
This assignment will contribute 15% to your final mark.
<P>
The assessment for the assignment recognizes the difficulty of the task, the importance of style, and the importance of appropriate use of programming methods (e.g. using while loops instead of a dozen if statements).

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
<tr><td align=right>60%<td><b>Correctness</b><br />
    <P>
The correctness of your program will be determined automatically by tests that we will run against your program. You will not know the full sample of tests used prior to marking. Your program must also find the word ladder(s) for a given input in the time limit specified above.

<tr><td align=right>20%<td><b>Your tests</b><br />
  You are required to write your own tests to ensure your program works.
  You will write tests in <code>euclidean_vector_test.cpp</code>. At the top of this file you will also include a block comment to explain the rational and approach you took to writing tests. Please read the <a href="https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md">Catch2 tutorial</a> or review lecture/tutorial content to see how to write tests.
  Tests will be marked on several factors. These include, but are not limited to
	<ul>
    <li>Correctness - an incorrect test is worse than useless.</li>
		<li>Coverage - your tests might be great, but if they don't cover the part that ends up failing, they weren't much good to you.</li>
		<li>Brittleness - If you change your implementation, will the tests need to be changed (this generally means avoiding calling functions specific to your implementation where possible - ones that would be private if you were doing OOP).</li>
		<li>Clarity - If your test case failed, it should be immediately obvious what went wrong (this means splitting it up into appropriately sized sub-tests, amongst other things).</li>
	</ul>

<tr><td align=right>15%<td><b>C++ style</b><br />Your adherence to good C++ style. This is <b>not</b> saying that if you conform to the style guide you will receive full marks for this section. This 20% is also based on how well you use modern C++ methodologies taught in this course as opposed to using backwards-compatible C methods. Examples include: Not using primitive arrays and not using pointers.

<tr><td align=right>5%<td><b>cpplint and clang-format</b><br />
In your project folder, run the following commands on all C++ files you submit:<br />
<code>$ clang-format -i /path/to/file.cpp && python cpplint.py /path/to/file.cpp</code>
<p>If the program outputs the following, you will receive full marks for this section (5%). Otherwise you will receive no marks.</p>
<pre>Done processing assignments/ev/euclidean_vector.cpp
Total errors found: 0</pre>

</table>

The following actions will result in a 0/100 mark for Word Ladder, and in some cases a 0 for COMP6771:
<ul>
<li>Knowingly providing your work to anyone and it is subsequently submitted (by anyone).
<li>Submitting any other person's work. This includes joint work.
<li>Submitting another person's work without their consent.
</ul>

<P>
The lecturer may vary the assessment scheme after inspecting
the assignment submissions but it will remain broadly similar to the description above.


<h3>4.5. Originality of Work</h3>
<P>
The work you submit must be your own work.  Submission of work partially or completely derived
from any other person or jointly written with any other person is not permitted.
The penalties for such an offence may include negative marks,
automatic failure of the course and possibly other academic discipline.
Assignment submissions will be examined both automatically and manually
for such submissions.</p>
<p>
Relevant scholarship authorities will be informed if students holding scholarships
are involved in an incident of plagiarism or other misconduct.</p>
<p>
Do not provide or show your assignment work to any other person &mdash; apart from the teaching staff
of COMP6771.
If you knowingly provide or show your assignment work to another person for any
reason, and work derived from it is submitted, you may be penalized, even
if the work was submitted without your knowledge or consent.  This may
apply even if your work is submitted by a third party unknown to you.</p>
<p>
Note you will not be penalized if your work has the potential to be taken without your consent or knowledge.
</p>

<h3>4.6. Submission</h3>
<P>
This assignment is due <b>Saturday 13th of July, 22:59:59</b>.
Submit the assignment using this <I>give</I> command:
</P>
<PRE>
give cs6771 euclideanvector euclidean_vector.cpp euclidean_vector.h euclidean_vector_test.cpp

</PRE>

<h3>4.7. Late Submission Policy</h3>
<p>
If your assignment is submitted after this date, each hour it is late reduces
the maximum mark it can achieve by 1%.
For example if an assignment worth 76% was submitted
5 hours late, the late submission would have no effect (as maximum mark would be 95%).
If the same assignment was submitted 30 hours late it would be awarded
70%, the maximum mark it can achieve at that time.
