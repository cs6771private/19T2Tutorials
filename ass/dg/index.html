<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p>Write a "Graph" Class Library in C++, with
its interface given in <code>graph.h</code>
and its implementation in <code>graph.tpp</code>.
</p>

<h3>1.2. Description</h3>

<p>In this assignment, you will write a Generic Directed Weighted
graph (GDWG) with value-like semantics 
in C++. Both the data stored at a node
and the weight stored at
an edge will be of generic types. Both generic types
may be different.
For example, here is a graph with nodes storing std::string and edges weighted by int:
</p>
<pre>gdwg::Graph&lt;std::string,int&gt; g;</pre>
<p>Formally, this directed weighted graph G=(N,E) will consist of
a set of nodes N and a set of weighted edges E. Give a node, 
an edge directed into it is called an <i>incoming edge</i> and
an edge directed out of it is called an <i>outgoing edge</i>. The
<i>in-degree</i> of a node is the number of its incoming edges.
Similarly, the
<i>out-degree</i> of a node is the number of its outgoing edges.
Given a directed edge from src to dst, src &rarr; dst, src is the <i>source</i> node
and dst is known as the <i>destination</i> node. G is a multi-edged
graph, as there may be two edges from the same source node to the
same destination node with two different weights. However,
all nodes are distinct, as they contain different data values.

<h3>3.5. Iterator</h3>

<p>You are required to define an iterator class <b>gdwg::Graph_iterator</b>.</p>

<p>The iterators will come in const and non-const forms, just like they would for any
built-in STL container. The iterators should respond to the *, ->, ++, --, == and !=
operators</p>

<p>When iterating through your graph the order of iteration should be based on the operator< for the underlying node type N</p>

<p>Your iterators should be appropriately declared as bi-directional. You should implement
and test the complete bi-directional iterator functionality. This includes pre/post incre-
ment and decrement. The post-increment/decrement operations should return a copy of
the value pointed to before the increment/decrement is performed.</p>

<h3>3.6. Internal Representation</h3>

<p>Your GDWG is <b>required</b> is required to use smart pointers.</p>

<h3>3.7. Throwing Exceptions</h3>

<p>You are required to throw exceptions in certain cases. These are specified in the tables above.</p>

<h3>3.8. Other notes</h3>
You must:
<ul>
  <li>Include a header guard in graph.h</li>
  <li>Use C++17 style and methods</li>
  <li>Ensure const-correctness of your code. In some cases we have assisted you by making const-correctness clear (e.g. gdwg::Graph&lt;N, E&gt;::find), however in other cases we require you to figure it by yourself</li>
  <li>Leave a moved-from object in a state with 0 nodes</li>
  <li>Mark all appropriate functions <i>noexcept</i>
</ul>

You must not:
<ul>
  <li>Write to any files that aren't provided in the repo (e.g. storing your graph data in an auxilliary file)</li>
  <li>Required to make any method explicit unless directly asked to in the spec.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.9. Const Correctness</h3>

<p>You must ensure that each method (2.3) and method (2.4) appropriately either has:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A const member function; or</li>
 <li>A non-const member function; or</li>
 <li>Both a const and non-const member function</li>
</ul>

<p>Please think carefully about this. The function prototypes intentionally do not specify their constness, except for one exception, the <b>at()</b> operator. This has an explicit const and non-const prototype to help you out.</p>

<p>In most cases you will only need a single function, but in a couple of cases you will need both a const and non-const version.</p>

<h2>4. Getting Started</h2>

<p>If you haven't done so already, clone the repository:</p>

<pre>$ git clone https://github.com/cs6771/comp6771 comp6771</pre>

<p>Then navigate to the <b>assignments/dg</b> directory</p>

<p>All of the files you need are in this directory. Here is a list of files that and a description of their purpose:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
	<tr>
		<th>File</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>client.(cpp|out)</td>
		<td>A simple use case of a client using your graph<br /><b>Note: Do NOT modify this file. We will potentially update it. If you want to modify it, make a local copy first.</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>graph.(tpp|h)</td>
		<td>Your GDWG interface and implementation.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>graph_test.cpp</td>
		<td>Your tests for your GDWG file</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
    <td>BUILD</td>
    <td>Build file containing build, test, dependency instructions</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<H3>4.2. Reference Solution & Time Limits</H3>

<p>Due to the simple nature of this data type, there will be performance based measurements</p>
<p>Each test will still have a time limit to run (1 second max), but unless you do something completely insane this will be more than enough time for all of your operations to complete.</p>

<h3>4.3. Running your assignment</h3>

<h4>4.3.1. Running a basic use case</h4>

<p>You can run your code against a basic (non-testing) use case to get a better sense of the behaviour</p>

<p>From your project directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ bazel build //assignments/dg:client</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ ./bazel-bin/assignments/dg/client | diff ./assignments/dg/client.sampleout -</code></pre>

<h4>4.3.2. Running your tests</h4>

<pre><code>$ bazel build //assignments/dg:graph_test</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ bazel run //assignments/dg:graph_test</code></pre>

<h3>4.4. Autotests</h3>
On a CSE machine you can run

<pre>6771 evtest</pre>

to test your code automatically. Note: graph.tpp and graph.h must be in that directory.

<H3>4.5. Assessment</H3>
<P>
This assignment will contribute 15% to your final mark.
<P>
The assessment for the assignment recognizes the difficulty of the task, the importance of style, and the importance of appropriate use of programming methods (e.g. using while loops instead of a dozen if statements).

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
<tr><td align=right>60%<td><b>Correctness</b><br />
    <P>
The correctness of your program will be determined automatically by tests that we will run against your program. We will create a series of test files that contain their own main function and are compiled with your GDWG file(s).</P>

<tr><td align=right>20%<td><b>Your tests</b><br />
  You are required to write your own tests to ensure your program works.

    <li>Correctness - an incorrect test is worse than useless.</li>
		<li>Coverage - your tests might be great, but if they don't cover the part that ends up failing, they weren't much good to you.</li>
		<li>Brittleness - If you change your implementation, will the tests need to be changed (this generally means avoiding calling functions specific to your implementation where possible - ones that would be private if you were doing OOP).</li>
		<li>Clarity - If your test case failed, it should be immediately obvious what went wrong (this means splitting it up into appropriately sized sub-tests, amongst other things).</li>
	</ul>

<tr><td align=right>15%<td><b>C++ style</b><br />Your adherence to good C++ style. This is <b>not</b> saying that if you conform to the style guide you will receive full marks for this section. This 20% is also based on how well you use modern C++ methodologies taught in this course as opposed to using backwards-compatible C methods. Examples include: Not using primitive arrays and not using pointers.

<tr><td align=right>5%<td><b>cpplint and clang-format</b><br />
In your project folder, run the following commands on all C++ files you submit:<br />
<code>$ clang-format -i /path/to/file && python cpplint.py /path/to/file</code>
<p>If the program outputs the following, you will receive full marks for this section (5%). Otherwise you will receive no marks.</p>

The following actions will result in a 0/100 mark for gdwg::Graph&lt;N, E&gt;, and in some cases a 0 for COMP6771:
<ul>
<li>Knowingly providing your work to anyone and it is subsequently submitted (by anyone).
<li>Submitting any other person's work. This includes joint work.
<li>Submitting another person's work without their consent.
</ul>

<P>
The lecturer may vary the assessment scheme after inspecting
the assignment submissions but it will remain broadly similar to the description above.


<h3>4.6. Originality of Work</h3>
<P>
The work you submit must be your own work.  Submission of work partially or completely derived
from any other person or jointly written with any other person is not permitted.
The penalties for such an offence may include negative marks,
automatic failure of the course and possibly other academic discipline.
Assignment submissions will be examined both automatically and manually
for such submissions.</p>
<p>
Relevant scholarship authorities will be informed if students holding scholarships
are involved in an incident of plagiarism or other misconduct.</p>
<p>
Do not provide or show your assignment work to any other person &mdash; apart from the teaching staff
of COMP6771.
If you knowingly provide or show your assignment work to another person for any
reason, and work derived from it is submitted, you may be penalized, even
if the work was submitted without your knowledge or consent.  This may
apply even if your work is submitted by a third party unknown to you.</p>
<p>
Note you will not be penalized if your work has the potential to be taken without your consent or knowledge.
</p>

<h3>4.7. Submission</h3>
<P>
This assignment is due <b>Sunday 3rd of August, 23:59:59</b>.
Submit the assignment using this <I>give</I> command:
</P>
<PRE>
give cs6771 graph graph.h graph.tpp graph_test.cpp
</PRE>

<h3>4.8. Late Submission Policy</h3>

<p>You can run some basic tests on your code on any CSE machine. In a folder that contains your files, simply run the following command:</p>

<pre>6771 dgtest</pre>

<b>Note: This test will not be available until the at the earliest the final 7 days before submission</b>

<h3>4.9. Late Submission Policy</h3>
<p>
If your assignment is submitted after this date, each hour it is late reduces
the maximum mark it can achieve by 1%.
For example if an assignment worth 76% was submitted
5 hours late, the late submission would have no effect (as maximum mark would be 95%).
If the same assignment was submitted 30 hours late it would be awarded
70%, the maximum mark it can achieve at that time.
