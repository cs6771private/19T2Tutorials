  Have you selected your group for ass3 yet?

<li>
  How many instantiations of max are generated?
  {{ include_code('questions/instant.h') }}
  <div class="answer">
    3
  </div>
</li>

<li>
  What is wrong with this implementation?
  {{ include_code('questions/stack.h') }}
  {{ include_code('questions/stack.cpp') }}
  {{ include_code('questions/stack_use.cpp') }}
  Compiled with <pre>g++ stack_use.cpp stack.cpp -o stack</pre>
  <div class="answer">
    Template definitions must be in the .h file because files using templates must be able to generate the code at compile time (as opposed to link time)
  </div>
</li>

<li>
  Convert the following class to a generic (templated) type.
  {{ include_code('questions/stringqueue.h') }}

  After converting it to a generic type:
  <ul>
    <li>Complete all incomplete implementations.</li>
    <li>Add an appropriate default constructor</li>
    <li>Add an appropriate copy constructor</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="answer">
    {{ include_code('solutions/stringqueue.h') }}
  </div>
  Finally, make the size of this queue a non-type parameter.
  <div class="answer">
    {{ include_code('solutions/stringqueuenontype.h') }}
  </div>
  What are the advantages and disadvantages of the non-type parameter?
  <div class="answer">
  <p><b>Advantage:</b> Improved performance. Size of a queue is determined at compile time requiring less to be done / processed at runtime.</p>
  <p><b>Disadvantage:</b> (1) Code explosion - instantiation created for a queue of every size. (2) Unable to copy construct easily</p>
  </div>
</li>
